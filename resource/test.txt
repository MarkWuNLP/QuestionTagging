How regressive is a sales tax?	Public Finance; Sales Tax; Quantitative Finance; 	(Sorry for the long description.)  It has been asserted that replacing income tax with a national sales tax would have many attractive features (Is implementing a "national sales tax" or "value added tax" to replace "income tax" a good idea? [ http://www.quora.com/Is-implementing-a-national-sales-tax-or-value-added-tax-to-replace-income-tax-a-good-idea ]) but an unattractive feature is that it would be highly regressive.   However, given that under current tax policies, producers' taxes are partially capitalized into the price of goods; this regressive side-effect of income taxes would be reduced with a sales tax.   Another factor is that a sales tax would shift resources into investment, potentially increasing incomes in the long run. If instead of considering the static image, we consider the discounted present value of future income/wealth, a sales tax may increase the income of the lowest quintile (and certainly that of those currently in the lowest quintile), thus ameliorating the impact of a sales tax on the poor.   To what extent are these (and other) factors out of balance?

Why are long-term capital gains tax rates lower than ordinary income tax rates?

What's the justification?

In the U.S., what would be the effect of replacing taxes on corporate income, capital gains, and estates with a periodic tax on household net wealth?	Asset Taxes; Income Tax; U.S. Federal Budget; Tax Policy; Economic Policy; Estate Tax; U.S. Economy; Economics; Business Taxes; Behavioral Economics; U.S. Taxes; Capital Gains Tax; 	Taxes on net wealth are typically assessed yearly.  Some potentially helpful data (from Wikipedia):  Total U.S. household net wealth: ~$60 trillion  Total U.S. government revenue from corporate income taxes and capital gains taxes: ~$300 billion  Thus, crudely speaking, the $300 billion in lost revenue could be replaced by a ~0.5% yearly tax on net wealth. If smaller asset pools were exempted the yearly tax might be slightly more.
Why doesn't Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax proposal include capital gains or estate taxes?	9-9-9 Plan; Flat Tax; Herman Cain; 	I'd be fairly supportive if he also added that carried interest was income, taxed estates at ~50%, and ST/1y/5y capital gains at something like 30/15/5 percent.
What would be the effect of eliminating the Corporate Income Tax and instead taxing all Capital Gain as Ordinary Income?	Corporate Tax Code; Tax Policy; Economics; United States Governments (Federal, State, Local); Business Taxes; U.S. Taxes; Income Tax; Capital Gains Tax; 	According to the NYT on 3/25/2011 (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html?_r=1&hp), Corporate Income Tax accounted for only 6.6% of Federal revenues.  From what I could find, Capital Gains Tax acocunts for ~3% of federal revenue.  Taxing it at ordinary income tax levels should effectively double the receipts (all things being equal).  And this would then take away one of the main arguments against taxing capital gains as ordinary income (namely--double taxation).  It seems like it would also help reduce all the contortions that companies go through to shelter profits from taxes which I have to assume are not great for the US economy (though are great for tax professionals).
What would happen if we swapped income tax rates with long term capital gains tax rates?	Questions That Contain Assumptions; Taxes; Income Tax; Tax Policy; Economics; Capital Gains Tax; 	i.e. income tax rates drop to about 15% and long-term capital gains taxes rise to about 30%.  Economic impact? Impact on government revenue?  Would the negative impact on the economy of fewer dollars invested be offset by the increased disposable income among wage earners?  Would the net impact be largely neutral and we'd just be favoring wage/salary laborers over rent seekers?

Is implementing a "national sales tax" or "value added tax" to replace "income tax" a good idea?	U.S. History; United States Governments (Federal, State, Local); Sales Tax; Business Taxes; Value Added Tax; Economic Policy; Public Policy; Fiscal Policy; Tax Policy; U.S. Politics; Income Tax; Economics; U.S. Federal Government; 	By "national sales tax" I am referring to a tax system by which the Government no longer taxes income, and instead uses a national tax percentage on goods bought.   This could be a more straightforward way of paying taxes, with less ability for evasion. What are the pros and cons of this?

When does the 3.8% tax on home sales (defined in the health care bill) apply?	Health Care Bill; Taxes; 	I've read around on the internet, but I am no tax expert. It seems the consensus from my readings is that it's 3.8% of the profit of a home sale, but the first $250,000 (if you're single) or $500,000 (as a couple) of that profit aren't taxed. And the tax itself only applies to singles making >$200,000, or couples making >$250,000 a year in gross income. But in calculating gross income,  I need to take into consideration the home sale. If I read correctly, in doing that I take the profit (not the sale value) of the home sale, subtract $250,000 for a single or $500,000 for a couple, and anything left is added to gross income. As an example, if I am single and make $150,000 a year, and sell my house, which I bought for $0, for $300,000, my gross income is calculated as $200,000, and therefore I pay 3.8% tax on $50,000 from the home sale...right?

How did Atlassian get their first few sales?	Startups; Business Development; Sales; Atlassian; 	Atlassian prides itself on not having a sales force, and having products that 'sell themselves'.  They are an awesomely impressive company, yet their success appears on the surface to be orthogonal to not having any outbound sales.  I can appreciate that once you reach a certain critical mass, and are a known brand that people come to you, but the adage of 'build it and they will come' is generally accepted to be a fallacy.  I'm curious if anyone who is familiar with the early days of Atlassian can speak to their startup style sales during the initial scaling stage (i.e.: before they were in a position to sponsor the beer).    When it was just Mike and Scott (or maybe 2/3 employees as well), and they've got JIRA, how did it get to the masses? Especially in 2001/2002 when social media was no where near what it is today, I'd love to learn more about how they scaled their business without direct/outbound sales.

Equity Dilution; Turnarounds (Business); Private Equity; Valuations; Series A Venture Investments; Growth Capital; Venture Capital; 	Trying to structure a turnaround bid for an online property which has already received structured capital (equity and convertible debt). The property has flat-lined but has potential with the right infusion of capital. The existing equity and convertible debt is at an unrealistic valuation given recent performance. What is the best way to put in growth equity, at a realistic valuation, and assume control of the company, while ensuring that existing (stubborn) shareholders will agree to the structure? Should it be new shares issued for a majority stake, or minority stake (with management control), but increasing share of equity based on future success, or other clever options?

Scottrade apparently doesn't have the bought price of stock my father purchased 25 years ago under a custodial account.  I want to file taxes in the safest way, but I don't want to overpay, obviously.  Someone on quora suggested that I tax my capital gain based on the difference between the lowest point of the stock in the year it was bought and the price at which it was sold.

What is a great employee to gross sales ratio for medium to high volume e-commerce companies/sites? And how is it achieved?	E-Commerce; 	I frequently hear about very small teams of people running multiple ecommerce or ebay sites that generate quite a bit of sales (100k+/mo). But they rarely give away specific figures or the name of their companies, anonymity still reigns supreme on the internet, but these claims dont see too far fetched considering what our own company is approaching.  So i'm wondering what types of volume are possible, and more specifically what new software or tools are being used out there to automate as much stuff as possible. I plan on keeping overhead at a minimum, which means i dont want to hire for as long as possible, and i dont plan on keeping much, if any inventory in a physical location (drop-shipping is our current model).  We have yet to decide on a platform to run our website, and are still just using ebay to generate 50k+/mo at the moment. My last company used an all in one solution (Infopia), but it's been about 3 years since, and so many new things are now available.

In this time of need why isn't the Govt. raising money through sales and consumption taxes instead of the income tax?	Microeconomics; Macroeconomics; Tax Policy; Politics; Economics; Taxes; United States Governments (Federal, State, Local); Government; The United States of America; Income Tax; 	There is a lot of talk about shifting to consumption tax. It's clear that both have their advantages and disadvantages. Why not raise the sales tax on purchases instead. if people want to buy something bad enough and have the money to do it.  Edit 3 : If there is a poverty threshold or a rebate mechanism it can  also prevent poorer people from getting hit by a tax which is tied to their spending and not income. For instance. Everyone gets a 20k consumption credit. They could roll it over to the next year to pay for the car or boat or other large ticket items they view as essentials. They can spend it on whatever they see fit, no one is played favorites with. As they spend more they pay more. This removes both Ryan and Adrian's concern. It can be rolled out as a supplementary tax system, transitioned into an Alternate tax system and then if all goes well migrated completely as the implementation is tweaked. That removes Seans and Matt's primary concern. In extreme cases where a person is making  $5 million(suggested by Matt)  but not spending anything an alternate minimum tax  tied to the income metric is calculated to ensure that a fair tax is still applied.  This would be applied to less that 1% of people that do fall under that high tax bracket but would ensure a fair tax on them too.  Examples where this would work better :  1) Income  50k a year but  10 Million in equity so you think it's ok to spend 400k a year.   This is an ideal example of someone who has a disincentive to work with the current tax system has all the money to be paying tax but doesn't.   2) Cash income from illegal activities. Grand lifestyle 200k a year spend.  3) A goes into Starbucks spends less than 25k a year pays 0% tax. B goes into Starbucks spends 400k a year pays a 50% tax. There's differential pricing based on the propensity to spend.  4) A makes $5 Million spends 50k. An alternate minimum tax threshold is calculated as a fair tax. The income metric is still being used but is'nt the primary driver. The wealth metric is.
Why haven't Universal Health Care costs been tied to consumption taxes (VAT, Sales Taxes)?	Politics; Health and Wellness; Taxes; 	This seems to be a natural choice. You live in an area/state/country, you pay sales taxes through consumption and you might need access to health services which is an inherently local business. It is fair (he who has more money consumes more, and everyone consumes), easy to administer (you don't have to do anything, most states already have some form of sales tax in place, actually you can reduce a lot of administrative work)

Is there any way to do the conversion from a single member LLC to C-Corp without having convertible notes from the LLC tax as capital gains when doing the conversion?	Tax Law; Startup Attorneys, Law and Legal Issues; Capital Gains Tax; Convertible Notes; Startups; 	Last year operating as one single member llc I did two funding rounds in form convertible loans. In order to raise more money in the future from institutional investors and make easier to issue stock to new employees I decided to convert from LLC to C-Corp. I made the process online using the same company I used when I did the incorporation. The conversion took place in December last year and since then I haven't issue any stock nor applied for a new EIN yet. A few days ago while doing last year taxes with my CPA, he told me that those convertible loans will be taxed as capital gains. The convertible loans were just an investment vehicle, the investors just want shares of the new formed corporation, there's no intention from the to recover that money. I would like to know if there's any way to revert to the LLC without tax implication or continue with the C-Corp without having to pay taxes for those convertible loans.

Is a low long term capital gains rate more of a "job killer" than higher margin income tax rates?	Capital Gains Tax; Unemployment; Economic Policy; Capital Flight; Job Creation; Tax Policy; Income Tax; Taxes; Economics; 	Defenders of our historically low long term capital gains rate defend it because they say it encourages investment.  But if it's encouraging investment in equities, wouldn't it be encouraging that investment at the expense of other uses for that capital like investing in a small business, or consumption, all which seem to create jobs more directly than an increase in the purchasing and holding of equities.  It seems this tax incentive would discourage job creation much more than the disincentive of a 4% higher top-level marginal tax rate.

Brian Olson : Hi Brian,  I guess I'm like the proverbial "taxi driver in Beverly Hills with a new screen play in my pocket looking for a producer to read it and make a movie out of it".    I found a very large niche market for online ecommerce.  Here is the concept.  Large retailers and online shopping sites control the majority of the online shopping exposure. In 2008 the Internet’s ecommerce industry was dominated by 500 companies who controlled 69.1% of all US retail web sales which totaled $178.2 billion. The purpose of KIKIJU.com (the name of my proposed web site) is to provide an online sales platform for the 1.6 million Small to Medium Size Business (SMB) retailers to advance their exposure and enhance their profits on the Internet and capture the remaining 30% ($53 billion) of the ecommerce market.  I have a detailed business plan, and I need to find a "producer" who can take it and make it happen.  Brian, do you have any suggestions?  Thank you.  Edison	Direct Question; 	
How can Apple gain a larger presence in Asia?	China; iOS; iPhone; Apple Inc.; India; Asia; 	I read that most of the worlds population is in Asia, and Apples presence is pretty small, yet the company is still worth over half a Trillion dollars.  What's stopping Apple from this market?  Is this the final frontier stopping them from becoming the worlds first trillion dollar company?  Do people in Asia (average Joe's) make enough to afford an iPhone, iPad, etc?  Is there an infastructure issue there?  Is there any social or political actions stopping Apple?   If so, what can they do to get their foot into the Market?  I'm not sure if Apple products are sold in any Asain countries, so sorry if this is wrong. But China and India are among the fastest growing countries, and they also have the most people, this should be a crucial move for them!  If there is something I'm missing, let me know!

How have successful flash sale sites (gilt.com, fab.com) garnered buy in from suppliers early on (pre-launch in particular and before they gained real notoriety), i.e. what was/is their B2B/2C marketing pitch?	Fab.com; Flash Sales; Gilt Groupe; Flash Sale Startups and Companies; 	I find that suppliers either "get it" right away or they don't have a clue - have never even heard of "flash slaes" - and therefore require significant onboarding. Obviously, I have to address these barriers to trial and I plan to do so, but would be great to get a sense of best practices on this side of the Flash Sale model.

Sales Enablement; Sales Management; SaaS Sales; Sales; Web Marketing; Sales and Marketing Automation; Direct Selling; 	When does it make sense not to use territories?  When you have certain size accounts?  When there more than X salespeople?  Assume there is good demand for the product, and there are lots of inbound leads right now that can be assigned to various sales people.

Should my pilot customer be my investor? If not, how do I structure the use of their risk capital?	Seed Funding; Venture Capital; Fundraising (Business); Customer Development; 	I have a technology that I would like to transition to a product.  There is some technological risk, and it will take $100K to productize this technology.  More detail: It's a very specific type of search engine. I estimate that it will cost roughly $100K to crawl the niche and index it. There is some execution/technical risk that must be overcome too.  I have had strong interest from potential customers. If this search engine works, it would be very valuable to them.  Should I accept $100K for pilot customers, and structure this risk capital as an investment in my company? Should I raise investment?  If I want to keep control and ownership of the company, what are alternative options? Can I make a deal that my pilot customers, in return for $100K, have a lifetime license to use my search engine, and simply pay operating costs (expenses) for their usage? I am not clear on what the pricing will ultimately be, so that makes it more difficult to figure out how to offer a discount.

SaaS Sales; Startups; Sales; MailChimp; Software-as-a-Service (SaaS); 	It's quite common that being a ESP, the sales cycle is rather long.

How should discount codes be applied for online retail sales?	Coupons; Sales Tax; 	What is best practice for applying dollar-value and percentage discount codes when there are taxes and shipping involved?  It seems that a dollar value code should be applied after tax and shipping is calculated... i.e., it spends like cash.    For percentage discounts, it's less clear.  It seems that percentage discounts should be applied to the product price at the line item level and not to shipping and certainly not to the tax.  Moreover, the merchant is responsible for the sales tax liability based on the price that the item is sold for.  If a user receives a 70% discount on an item, then the tax is going to be lower as well.

How do you model a small business sales pipeline?	Sales; 	Most of the sales pipeline models I have found do something like this: Sum all the prospects in a stage, multiply that sum by the probability of that stage closing, then finally summing all of the values of all the stages to determine the pipeline value.  This makes sense to me when all of the prospects in a single stage are similarly valued and/or there are *many* prospects in each single stage. But what if there are only a few prospects and/or one enormous prospect and several small ones in a single stage? Computing the value of a single stage to be the sum of those prospects times the probability of that stage closing could be disastrous.  Is there a better model for small companies with inhomogeneous prospect distributions?  Thanks!

In the US, do good teachers support teachers unions? If so, why?	Education; K-12 Education; Teachers' Unions; Education in the U.S.; Teachers; Education Reform and Disruption; 	Teachers unions value seniority over quality by pushing for tenure, by advocating for earning increases based primarily on years teaching instead of teaching quality. The unions also protect their bad members instead of disassociating from them, which lowers the public perception of the profession as a whole. A unions purpose is support safe and fair working conditions, not to shelter inferior workers.  Good, hard working teachers would benefit from having a system that rewards them for their efforts instead of just giving rewards to whomever hangs around longest. If you are such a teacher and you support a union, why do you do so? Do you disagree that there are more senior teachers getting by on less than exemplary effort?   Yes, of course there are other senior teachers doing a fantastic job.

Who is the best basketball player ever?	NBA; 	I'm looking for an objective answer that first defines what they consider the best and how "X" player is the best, preferably by someone who's been around the game a long time.  I'm not asking who was the most hyped/did the most for the league's popularity...that is an easy answer...Michael Jordan.  Although Michael Jordan can indeed be proven the best, I'm not so sure he is.  If you define the best by greatest champion, it's Russell (11 rings). If you go by most impressive stats, I think it's Wilt (56 NBA single season records vs 6 for MJ). Another reason why it's a really tough question to answer objectively is how can you really compare players of different eras, style of play, position, situations they were in, etc.  Just one example, the Bulls great teams were built around Michael Jordan being their best player.  How would Jordan have responded if he was in the same situation as Kobe and had to play your first few years designated to be only the second best player on your team (behind Shaq).  I'm not trying to bash Jordan, I grew up thinking he was the best and would always be the best, but as I grew up and learned more about the game, I realized the media/people made his image infallible at the time (it seems it's never brought up he was swept by Bird's Celtics twice) and made it seem like MJ did it all himself (Pippen led Bulls almost made it to the Conference Finals) and did not give the correct respect for the people that came before him at the time. Again, I'm not saying the correct answer is not MJ, I'm just not sure.  I am only a fan of the NBA so I'm probably not as educated as those that are in the league or get paid to follow it.

Direct Question; 	I used to work a lot in HyperCard, Supercard and Spinnaker PLUS, all which employed variants of the 'HyperTalk' clone that Metacard (and in turn, LiveCode) employ (or so I believe).

Games; Web Design; Marketing Communications; Marketing; Communication Design; Game Design; 	I'm the co-creator of Thinkinvisible (thinkinvisible.tumblr.com), which is a site with unique visual brain teasers. There is also an iPhone game on its way which will make it way more interactive. The original plan was to "go viral" but it seems like that won't happen;). We tried to contact as many design blogs and sites as we could without much success. So there are two possible reasons why:  * This project just won't cut it. It's not interesting or unique enough to go viral, period.  * We have a problem with how we communicate it. Which one is the case, in your opinion?  What would be the "ideal platform" for this project? Should we go into fashion? Or focus on the game instead? Try to sell prints? Thanks!:)

What small things can people do to make daily life easier for each other?	Life Advice; Tips and Hacks for Everyday Life; Life; Good; Society; 	Two examples of the many things I do to try and be nice:   1. Keep small change in my wallet - mostly 1 RMB coins - and lower denomination notes so I don't have to use 100 RMB notes with taxi drivers. They don't like to give out their coins either. If my journey comes to 37 RMB and I only have a 50 RMB note, I will pay 52 RMB so he needn't waste three coins in change. He can give me 15 RMB in notes.   2. When I go through passport control - which I do fairly often - I always have my passport open on the picture page with my ticket bookmarking the visa page. This negates the need for the security guy to waste seconds flicking through the pages, thus saving him time and that of the people behind me in the line. Seconds only, but if everyone did it lots of time would be saved.   These things are just common sense to me, but I am constantly surprised how few people do such things. I'm forever stuck in line behind the person who didn't get their purse from their bag until they reached the checkout.   What are some other simple ways we can help each other out and make life run more smoothly?
What can an Amazon customer do to make life easier for their warehouse workers?	Order Fulfillment; Warehouse Management; Survey Questions; Amazon; 	There have been a few articles published recently about how tough it is to work at Amazon.  Is there anything an average user can do to make life easier or more pleasant for their warehouse folks?   One example: if I'm ordering more than one thing, does it make life better for them if I place two separate orders, or if I put both things in one order?  Another example: Does it cut the pressure if I ask for standard shipping instead of two-day shipping?  It would be nice if there were a way to sneak a "thank you, I appreciate what you do" note into the order somehow, so it would get printed on the pick ticket where the person might see it. It would be even better if I could give them a tip. But that will never happen.  Any suggestions?

If Mathematical conclusions are discovered then how can somebody invent something? Read the description before answering..	Mathematics; Science; 	I had this question in my mind for a long time and i have asked this in many arenas but with unsatisfactory answers?  Conventionally it is believed that it is a discovery for obvious reasons..   Then any physical world inventions should also be called as discoveries because the configuration already existed before the invention(just like a mathematical conclusion.  For example - Pythagoras theorem conclusions were always there)  now tell me the answer...
How can Captain America have a vibranium shield before Tony Stark invents vibranium in Iron Man 2?	Captain America; Avengers; Movies; Iron Man (Marvel Comics character); Marvel Comics; S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Comics); Tony Stark (Marvel Comics character); Iron Man 2 (2010 movie); 	In the trailer for next year's Captain America film, he is seen with his signature shield (presumably made of Vibranium).  However, from Iron Man 2, Howard Stark says that they do not have the technology to create vibranium (the new element) until Tony himself makes it in his basement.  There is a seeming discrepancy here, unless I'm missing something (the shield made of something other than what Tony made, what Tony's new element made isn't vibranium, etc.)
How is it that Facebook can’t really invent any new online behaviors that would keep people addicted to Facebook?	Facebook; Facebook Product, Products, and Interactions; 	Question stolen from this post from Om Malik [ http://www.quora.com/Om-Malik ]: Why Poke's decline shows Facebook's inability to invent [ http://gigaom.com/2012/12/26/snapchat-rises-why-pokes-decline-shows-facebooks-inability-to-invent/ ].  "How is that Facebook, which has some of the smartest folks in the room, can’t really invent any new single online behavior that would keep people addicted to Facebook?  Why does it have to look at others to come up with new user behaviors and new features? For instance, checkins came from Foursquare, while the short status updates were a direct response to Twitter. Facebook Answers were nothing but a variation on Quora’s offering. Poke is yet another example.

What are the most interesting games that have been invented recently? How difficult is it to invent such things?	Graph Theory; Board Games; Game Theory; Go (board game); Video Games; Strategy Games; Casual Video Games; Chess; Games; Tabletop Games; Mathematics; 	I am most interested in games that have simple rules but extremely complex/deep gameplay, things like Go and Chess, or perhaps Hex (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)) for a recent one. I prefer games without any randomness, but if you think that modern board games, things analogous to Settlers of Cataan/Carcasonne are, are good answers nonetheless feel free to say so.   I am also curious about what fraction of the 'state space' of games are extremely deep games, and if there are any modern developments that allows us to better understand this problem.   This question is inspired by Anonymous [ http://www.quora.com/ ]'s pair of questions: Go (board game): How is the 9x9 Go different from the 19x19 Go? [ http://www.quora.com/Go-board-game/How-is-the-9x9-Go-different-from-the-19x19-Go ] and How would chess be different on a 19x19 board? [ http://www.quora.com/How-would-chess-be-different-on-a-19x19-board ] and the answers contained therein (it is also inspired by the fact that I was going to buy a board game and organize a game night with some of my friends, and probably the inception of the idea was reading Nash's biography, especially the section about Hex and the efforts of mathematicians to understand the game).  I think that some mathematics, graph theory in particular because Go, Chess, Hex, etc are graphs, must be deeply related to this issue, or maybe some physics, so I included mathematics/graph theory as a topic. If you disagree let us discuss it (it might make an interesting discussion).
How does Keynotopia compare to Powerpoint, Photoshop, Axure or Balsamiq for quick prototyping?

How useful are prototyping tools like UXPin for paper prototypes?	Tools; Prototyping; 	I usually pin up a big sheet of paper, grab some marker pens and post it notes and jam UI ideas with designers and devs, then sketch them out in a cleaner form, or take them into a wireframing tool like omnigraffle if needed. Then walk through the user flows.  Has anyone used things like UXPin - does it help or get in the way? What are your approaches to paper prototyping?

How do I find a good resource for HTML/CSS/JS prototyping?	HTML5; 	Okay, so we have the basic html/css/js covered and some frameworks.  Now, how about some advanced techniques for working with prototypes in HTML.   How do we handle variables? How do we best separate our html in different template files?  How do we best link between templates and/or include templates in each other (like with php include)?  How do we add meta information like annotations in a clever way?  When asking these questions I take for granted that we are awesome at HTML/CSS and somewhat used to writing JS.

Are consumer complaints made too easy?	Customer Relationship Management (CRM); Gripe (company); Social CRM; Customer Service; 	See this NYT article for more background: "From the vendor’s perspective, a small number of complaining customers who use social media receive disproportionate attention. This is “social bullying,” in the opinion of Ashutosh Roy, the chief executive of eGain, which provides customer service products for its corporate clients. He observes that his clients determine their response to complaints registered by a given customer “not just by how much business you do with the company but also by how much pain you inflict on the company in social channels.”" http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/technology/29digi.html

How can we eliminate "force quit" by replacing it with something that is easier to understand?	Graphical User Interfaces (GUI); Human-Computer Interaction; Operating Systems; 	Nowadays, the trend is to hide whether an application is running or not.  It's not important.  When you click its icon, it should just resume from where you left off.  But the concept of "force quit" doesn't fit well with this trend. Why should the user be expected to know that he/she should "force quit" an app when it is not behaving correctly?  What could we replace "force quit" by that would make more sense?

A Clockwork Orange (1962 Novella); Literature; Anthony Burgess (author); Literature of the United Kingdom; Language; 	Burgess himself maintains that ‘it will take the reader no more than fifteen pages to master and revel in the expressive language of “nadsat”, after that he has before him an easily digestible feast of picaresque villainy and social satire.’   Is that the case? I'm interested in your experience of reading the novel — preferably the British edition — for the first time.

Maybe there already is a very good one out there? what is it? How popular is the most popular one, and how do I make my app more searchable on there?  I want to be able to search for "I want an app that lets me do this."   Also, everybody and their mother (literally) has an app idea. They tell me, "can you make me an app that does this, and this is how it should work", I want to tell them to stick this exact sentence into a special search engine, and see what comes up first.

Should I encourage freshmen to register for a class I'll be taking so that they can lower the average score and make it easier for me to get a high GPA?	Ethics; Manipulation; Higher Education; Education; Colleges and Universities; 	I should be able to get a high GPA either way because I've heard that it's not a very intense or difficult course but I think it might be kind of fun to encourage a bunch of freshman to sign up for it. If I promote the class on my university's Facebook page, I can probably get a fair number of people to sign up for the class, and from my observations I believe that this would have a nontrivial effect on the grade distribution.

How can I make money from making music compilations?	Compilation Albums; iTunes; Wanting and Making Money; Testing Ideas; Websites; Startup Ideas; Music; Music Industry; 	The Kaiser chiefs latest album is revolutionary in the music industry. For 7,50 pounds, a fan kan handpick 10 out of 20 songs he/she wants on the cd. Their particular compilation can then be bought by other fans, in case the original compiler earns 1 pound.   Is there a website or app that allows you to compile your own selection of music, which can then be bought? My reasoning for this is as follows: there is an ever growing amount of music, and record companies only make a handfull of (mostly mediocre) compilations. This means inevitibally a lot of good music lands into obscurity, even though a big percentage are modern evergreens.   An app or website that let's individuals compile music and then sell  those compilations, would be a huge benefit for the artist, the  compiler, and the consumers: artist gets money and airplay, compiler  gets money and satisfaccion in spreading great music that would  otherwise be very difficult to discover, and consumers get guided to  great music.  Just like Apple can't come up with al those great app-ideas, record companies themselves can not play guide to the exploding amount of music.   Thus, there is a need for an easy, well thought-out platform that allows  an army of passionate music lovers to "keep the music alive". Does this exist? Will somebody make it, you think? What are the barriers for such a thing to become reality?

What is the easiest alcohol to make at home?	Brewing; Liquor and Spirits; Homebrewing; Alcohol; 	A few friends and I are trying to get into home brewing beer. But before we get into it (relatively complicated in a place where hops and barely are very difficult to buy) I'm thinking about brewing something else first.  I've looked into mead, which looks simple enough. Is there something easier? More delicious? The only form of alcohol I've ever not enjoyed was Vodka. Just about anything else is delicious.  Some problems. I'm a mega-city dweller. My apartment doesn't have much for storage space (for aging), and I cant grow grapes or anything like that because I have no yard.

If I can find one that helps out with AIDS and/or Human Trafficking, I want to commit.

I was thinking of going half and half this year with GF and a Human Trafficking organization; but I want to find a group that is honest and good.   Why aren't more philanthropic organizations open about their budget and spending? Why can't it be easy to do good?

Has the internet made truth easier to discover?	Web Search; Science; 	What I have noticed recently, is that the larger the audience in a discussion, the more likely it is that truth rises to the surface. This isn't always the case but if a good cross section of people are engaged, usually one can make a reasonable conclusion based on the information that is conveyed. So, my question really pertains to the idea that the internet has become an excellent filter to weed out fallacy and discover truth, through the wisdom of the masses.

How can learning be made cool?	Society; Learning; Culture (social science); Education; 	It seems like if someone really wants to learn they will perform much better in school and in life. I think a great way to get there is if learning became cool.

So how can we, as a society, make learning cool? And how can each of us do our part?  I think if we can accomplish this it'd be one of the most impactful cultural changes that we can make.

How can I make myself look older?	Physical Appearance; Aging (biology); Makeup; 	I work in professional services and often am presenting to very senior management. I'm a male in my late 20s, but look like I'm in my early 20s. Before I speak I often sense that the executives are skeptical about what I'm going to say and sometimes tune out, even if what I say is insightful and accretive to the conversation. A few have made disparaging remarks about my boyish looks that I'm forced to shrug off with a laugh. I feel like this is also holding me back with my partner who praises my analytical abilities and trusts me with all of the work, but shows hesitation around giving me ownership with clients, frequently commenting that I need more experience. I'm meaningfully more experienced than other principals at my level or a level beneath me who don't seem to experience these issues. Any help is appreciated!

How can I make my mother happier?	Life; Failure; Psychology; Motherhood; Success; 	My mother is feeling very upset right now.  She divorced 8 years ago and now that I'm studying in the U.S. she is pretty much alone.  She always told me how smart she was when she was a student but she didn't end up "achieving" a lot, according to her.  She actually has a pretty good job, not exactly prestigious nor highly paid, but good nevertheless.  What's making her most upset is the fact that she is 50 now and she isn't as healthy and energetic as she was years ago, so she feels like she can do nothing to change her circumstances right now (though her circumstances are by no means bad).  She always compares herself to her high-school/college classmates and becomes upset when those who she thinks were not as smart as she was turned out more successful.  I feel like the biggest problem my mother is having right now is she is too inclined to compare herself with others.  I wonder what I should tell her to make her happy and feel good about herself?

Fedora (GNU/Linux OS); Linux; KDE; Red Hat Linux; System Administration; Computer Networking; Ubuntu; 	I am running a version of RHCE6 on my laptop, and lately I've been trying various stuff about network configuration through command line. Last night, I tried removing the NetworkManager using "yum remove NetworkManager" from the system, so that I could have more control of the network through the command line. But the result is, I didn't manage to configure the wireless connection through wpa_supplicant, and I need wireless connection during my travel to another place. So I need the wireless function back as soon as possible. I typed " yum install NetworkManager", some version installed, but I don't get to have an icon on the taskbar, and of course, the network doesn't work. The package I previously removed(about 24MB) was much larger that the one I just installed(about 2MB), so I think some dependencies must be missing. How could I install all these dependencies? Please help!

How can I make branches track only themselves?	Git (revision control); 	Hi guys!  Firstly, apologies if I’ve worded my question completely wrong, but hopefully this extension should clear anything up.  I use Git daily, and have done for about 18 months now. I’m getting a lot more confident with things like branching, merging, rebasing etc, but one of the seemingly more fundamental aspects has passed me by…  How can I ensure that any branch I work on pushes and pulls only between the remote and local versions of itself?  I thought I had this nailed, with this in my `.gitconfig`: dotfiles [ https://github.com/csswizardry/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig#L32-L33 ]  That seems to honour a push just fine… I did actually try creating a corresponding [pull] setting, but running the following workflow gave me the old ‘You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you want to merge with…’ error. The workflow I mentioned was:  1. Checkout my fully up-to-date local master branch. 2. Create a branch off of that called `try/responsive` (`git checkout -b try/responsive`) 3. Do some work, `git push` (no problems here). 4. Someone else pushed to the remote `try/responsive` branch. 5. I run a simple `git pull` and I get that error.   Now, I understand that I could run `git pull origin try/responsive`, but my questions is this:   * How does Git work by default? What tracks what and why? What other options are there?  * How can I set my global config so that push and pull only work between local and remote versions of the same branch?   Apologies if I missed any information, and if I made that longer than I needed to. I’d really appreciate any advice on this :)  Thanks, Harry  Edit: Apologies is this type of question is more suited to somewhere like Stack Overflow. I toyed with the idea of posting it there but my reasoning was that SO feels more like a ‘How do I do abc?’ whereas here feels more like a ‘Hey, why does this work like xyz?’

How could FCC rules be changed to make it easier for small businesses to participate in the "Internet of Things"?	Electronics; Small Businesses; 	With the introduction of low energy Bluetooth technology, we are about to see a huge number of new business opportunities associated with smart devices. Because Bluetooth devices are "intentional  radiators", they require FCC certification as class B devices. The problem is that such certification can cost thousands of dollars (I've read as much as $40K), which is too much to make it feasible for a small business to get into the game of designing and selling Bluetooth-enabled smart devices. How might current rules be changed to help small businesses compete, while not compromising the ability of smart devices to remain non-interfering? For a good discussion on this topic, see http://www.bigmessowires.com/2011/11/05/fcc-testing-for-open-hardware/.

Why do computer video cables (VGA, etc.) have mounting screws?	Computer Peripherals; Computer Hardware; 	I was hooking my LCD monitor back up after a move, and this question popped into my head.  The power cable seems just as, if not more, important than the video cable, yet the video cable has mounting screws while the power cable doesn't.

I don't see those types of cables much anymore, but new types of connectors (USB, Firewire, etc.) don't seem to have any type of retention hardware.    Is there some reason why video cables have retained these screws and other cables have not?
Who the hell is responsible for the automatic updates in Windows 7?	Windows 7; User Research; 	It doesn't ask me when it is convenient for me as the user to update the gd computer.

For my friend, it happened as he wanted to quickly shut down his computer as he was out the door to catch a plane. This appears to be a completely idiotic feature that I have no control over.

If I'm getting mediocre grades in Discrete Mathematics, does this mean I'm screwed for upper division Computer Science courses?	Studying Math; Studies and Studying; Mathematics; Computer Science; Computer Science Education; 	I'm college sophomore taking various classes along with Discrete Mathematics. I'm pretty much getting C's on all the Discrete Math exams. I do all the problem sets and study hard, but the exams are just damn difficult with all those crazy proofs.

Even if I could still I already have one Kinect, so why buy another one? Hence I am just curious, as the hw is probably the same, if there is some hack or firmware update that could fix it.

Do you know of any Arduino projects that are similar or relevant for what I have in mind?  I have experience building DIY audio amplifiers, so I see no reason why this project would be beyond my current technical abilities.

What exactly would I have to keep in sync?

Workflow; Getting Things Done (system); Information and Communications Technology (ICT); Microsoft Windows; Desktop Virtualization; Productivity; Virtualization; Computers; 	I'm using the term "workspace" because I don't know what else to call it. Here's what I want to do: Let's say I have several online businesses. For each one, I have a separate Gmail and Twitter and Quora account, separate bank account, etc. I want to be able to have them all going at once, so I can switch between them quickly, and also cut and paste data from an app in one workspace to an app in another.  I know about virtual desktops, but the problem is the browser. If I use the same browser in all virtual desktops, won't it get confused with all the different cookies and history and passwords (across different instances of the same browser)? I would also like to keep different sets of bookmarks (but that's not a deal-breaker).  I was thinking about using virtual machines, one for each business, but it seems like overkill.  BTW, I don't need separate monitors to see everything at the same time, I'm happy to switch back and forth, as long as I can copy and paste between them.

How can I learn not to get screwed over and screw other people over?	Life Advice; Social Psychology; Social Advice; Self-Improvement; 	I have been the victim of politics a lot. In a student organization I was in, people would take credit for all my work (when they didn't do anything), but blatantly yelling at them or disagreeing with them in public doesn't seem to help my public image.

It has happened multiple times I had my work taken away as someone's credit. My friends say I'm too soft/weak, and need to learn to be tough and give out the aura that people shouldn't mess with me.

Am I screwed? (About getting into college)	Computer Science; Academic Degrees; University of Maryland, College Park; College and University Admissions; College Applications; Colleges and Universities; 	I'd first like to apologize for my possibly repetitive and redundant post. I'm quite sleep deprived at the moment.  I consider myself an intelligent person. The thing is... I've had crappy grades the past few years. I'm in my Junior year (11th) of American high school. My GPA has mostly hovered between greater than or equal to 2.0 and less that 3.0. I only recently achieved a 3.0 unweighted GPA for this past quarter (half of a semester). My weighted GPA is 3.7. I am currently taking 4 AP courses. I used to take the highest math classes available (Initially Algebra 1 in 6th grade, in which I got some As), but I flunked out of them as I lost interest. I have no inherent difficulty in these subjects. I am on the debate team, and I love it. When I'm a senior next year, I'm going to be a captain. I've made it to debate finals every year of high school so far. I have a Degree of Excellence stamp from the National Forensics League.  My problem is that I put almost no time into my schoolwork because I'm distracted by my other projects.  I'm a developer. I've made 2 iOS apps, and I'm working on a LOT of things right now. I think I'm pretty skilled for my age and I think my experience at this stage in my programming career is impressive. I love BIG ideas. I like working on cool, large projects (or small projects from which I can learn new skills fundamental to various areas). I'm interested in AI/NLP, Machine Learning, big data, yada yada yada.   I really, really enjoy the theory aspect of computer science. I don't just consider myself a programmer, I consider myself a computer scientist. I'm interested in all sorts of things. I like abstract concepts, and I even enjoy the implementation. So I really, really want to go to university. I want to have an academic forum in which I can converse, learn, and research. I love the Internet for gaining programming knowledge, but I'd also like to attend university to get a deep, thorough understanding of the field on a theoretical level. To me, the Internet is missing some necessary context that I hope university can provide.  But here's the thing: I spend almost all my time programming, reading technical books, and doing other things that are not JUST very educational, but, to me, extremely fun. In the process, I've neglected my grades; though I have recently made somewhat of a push to improve. My grades once again dipped, and I'd be surprised if I managed to pull off a 3.0 for the entire semester.   I want to go to college, very much, for the experience. My motivation is almost entirely intrinsic. I have faith in myself and my abilities, and I believe I can become successful without a degree. I'm not really concerned about employment. I don't plan on depending on a college degree for a job. It wouldn't hurt though, if my planned business ventures end up failing.  So... am I totally screwed? Assuming I can get my unweighted GPA to around 3.7 and get 2200-2300 on my SATs (Given my past practice scores, I believe I can pull this off with a moderate amount of effort), do I have a chance of getting into a decent college? What if I get 2200-2300 on my SATs but my GPA is in the low 3s?   While I just want to go to a school with good environment and a good computer science program, I'd especially like to go to UMD.  I'd appreciate any UMD-specific advice, if any of you have gone to/are going to UMD.

Did I just screw myself over at work?	Jobs; Manners and Etiquette; Work; Too Reliant on Question Details; 	I'm a co-op student working at an organization, the first one ever to work at this organization. That is why people suspect someone introduced me. I actually had no idea, but I soon learned this "person" actually held a very high role in the company, and she is not necessarily well-liked by some employees, actually by the ones I talk most to at work and eat for lunch.  I've tried to dodge the question many times but my coworker put me on the spot today and I felt I had no choice but to answer. She said, so who introduced you A or B in front of everyone. I answered.   Did I just screw myself? The people I eat with have not bad-mouthed her but did not necessarily say good things about her. I just kept my mouth shut every time because I'm not the type to gossip... I actually don't know the person who introduced me very well and don't care that she is being badmouthed by others.  What do you advise?  I leave for school in one month though xD
I screwed up my life, is it too late?	Career Advice; Life Advice; Life; Technology; 	I'm 27 and a two time convicted felon. It was my fault these things happened and there is no real excuse for my actions. When I was 19 I committed Forgery and got probation. I completed it. At 25 years old, I committed Embezzlement and was sentenced to probation that I'll be on until April. This last time sadly woke me up to the fact I won't be young forever. I don't want to end up in jail for the rest of my life. I'm tired of messing up. Long story aside, I have a love for technology and ironically law enforcement. I'm currently in school for Information Technology and will graduate next May, I have also taken a few programming courses here and there. Is it too late to get into this field with my mistakes?

Geeks; Microsoft; Operating Systems; Microsoft Windows; Programmers; Windows 8; 32-Bit; 64-Bit; 	I had installed 32-bit Windows 7.

Both versions use the same filesystem format, so all the installer is doing is copying files!  It should be possible to just remove the old ones and copy the news ones and preserve the installed programs, settings, and user files!

Screwed up the first date, what now?	Women; Girlfriends; Date Ideas; 	I was able to get a girl's number and we *texted* a bit before I asked her out. She readily said 'yes' and I was ecstatic because she seemed perfect. On the big night, I reach the place late by 15 minutes all apologetic carrying nothing for her.  But she was really calm and we went ahead and ordered dinner. Then we decide to go to an American Country Music Bar (she's into Country). She was all excited about it, and she mentioned before hand that she'd be wearing Cowboy boots for the bar. We reach the bar and the bouncer doesn't let me in. He says that he couldn't let me in because I was not having an American license or carrying my passport. It was embarrassing. He didn't seem friendly at all. It seemed like I was probably the first *Indian* that person has ever seen. We had to travel for 25~30 minutes just to reach that place. I had to apologize again and we went back to the place where we parked her car. It was probably the most awkward drive ever. What a horrible ending it was to a 0/10 night.   But I do not want to accept defeat and try to test waters again by asking her if she wants to go to the Cal - Cardinals game later next month. I can arrange for the best tickets for the game. But currently, it seems like she doesn't give a damn about me. She says 'She's been super busy of late'. Is there a way I can convince her that I won't be screwing it up again?

What's the best way to tell your contractor they screwed up?	Real Estate; Home Improvement; Home; Contractors; 	I recently hired a contractor to restain my cedar fence. I've had it painted twice before and it has always been great, this time I used a new contractor and he's made a mess of it. He cut every corner: instead of hand painting the fence he used a spray gun which doesn't work with stain and instead of sanding he power washed. I feel like this is partly my fault -- I didn't watch him paint the fence -- but the end result is splotchy and awful with potentially long lasting damage. He's done a bunch of work -- just really badly. Some examples: - splotchy and inconsistent color of the stain on the fence - some places too much paint, some places too little leaving an irregular look - by powerwashing he left marks on the fence (i.e. power washing "circles" where he over power washed)- these probably need to be sanded out? Can they be?  - he over sprayed in some areas -- particularly on the deck, which means the house now has stain on it.  What's the appropriate way to respond in this situation?

Why penguin screwed us how and who. Share your input!	Organic SEO; 	 Google’s Penguin Update: What it is, What it isn’t, and What to Do As everyone already knows, Google’s Penguin Algo update targets what it deems to be ‘webspam’: both onsite, and offsite (links). The update’s intent was not to reward ‘quality’ sites – per se – in spite of Cutts’ spin. The primary aim of this update was, first and foremost, to punish sites that engage in ‘unnatural’ link building.    So, if you engaged in unnatural link building, and have sites that either moved up in rankings or held their position, it’s not that you did something right or your site is of necessarily higher quality than your competitors that got the axe. It’s that your site’s link profile, relative to the specific section of the total link graph to which your site’s niche belongs, didn’t do things as ‘wrong’ as the sites that got destroyed did. This explains why garbage has risen up significantly across all verticals – these sites are in nearly every instance complete non-offenders. Therefore, Penguin (in conjunction with Panda) deems them of higher ‘quality’ since there is no way for them to trip the algo as engaging in link spam. Only from the mind of Google, right…?  In spite of whether or not you have survived Penguin, looking only at what off-site stuff you have done for answers is to misunderstand the Penguin update. This is why so many people can really and truly say that they have sites that survived, and even gained rankings in some instances, despite having ‘incorrectly’ used certain automated tools, heavily spun content, or full-on blackhat methods. These sites simply did not crap where they were eating to the extent that their competition did.  In short, to understand the winners and losers in your niche, you have to analyze the profiles of, at least, the top 10 winners, relative to your own site’s profile – forget comparing your site’s link portfolio to other losing sites; and, stop trying to find commonalities with sites that lost that have nothing to do with your niche, since, again, different niches have offended differently as a group.   Google’s Link Graph, Their Continuing Attempts to Master the Semantic Web, Human Behavior Tracking on the Internet, and Backlink Organicity  A fancy (if not long-winded) heading, but there’s really no other way condense it. Luckily, there is a fairly simple way to explain it:  Google has been in dogged pursuit of understanding human language, colloquialisms, what people actually mean as opposed to what they might type (and how to distinguish such things) from the beginning, and they have made a lot of headway. In making that headway, Google – by default – is better able to understand organic linking patterns across their crawls of the Web, synonym-based content spins, and which backlinks just stick-out as inorganic, without any further analysis whatsoever of any other of a link’s characteristics. The net result for Google is a more refined understanding of their link graph as a whole, and where it is being manipulated the most. Many of you have found getting a thing indexed lately to be difficult, and this is why: it now falls under Google’s refined definition of spam.  Google couples this improved understanding of the Semantic Web with an almost unbelievable amount of data now at its fingertips about what people do online. Predictable patters. From that, it can be statistically extrapolated what people do not do online, as a matter of regularity. Ergo, we enter a whole new world with the Penguin update: Penguin actually does identify link spam very, very well; the problem – and I think this is something we can all agree upon – is that it is exactly link spam that, for the most, and not without its irony, actually gave really good search results. Having said that, Joe and Suzie Websurfer are unlikely to take any notice of the changes. Put another way, whatever Google puts in front of Joe Public is going to be just fine with Joe Public, so if you rely on organic search to make money, you’re the one with the problem – not Google.  Why Your “White Hat” Site Got Nailed  Almost all people claiming that their “White Hat” website got hit fall into one of four categories:  1.) You didn’t understand what Google considers “White Hat” and built links according to that misunderstanding, 2.) Your White Hat site is being retroactively punished for things you did that once were White Hat, but now are not after the Penguin update. 3.) Your site is collateral damage from the update – a glitch in the matrix; or, 4.) The linking patterns established by the people linking to your site tripped the algo (this can happen to perfectly White Hat sites that do not lend themselves to what the algo is programmed to see as ‘organic’ anchor diversity/linking).  I, myself, have 2 White Hat sites that were wiped out; the only premeditated link building ever done for them being press releases. However, these two sites really only lent themselves to being linked to organically with 4 or 5 different anchors, each; these sites tripped the algo in spite of no fault on my behalf. Frustrating? You bet. Moving on…  Google’s Definition of “Link Scheme” Just Got Realer   There is nothing – whatsoever – organic about backlink tiering/pyramiding in the way we’ve all been doing it to manipulate SERPs. We’ve all grown very accustomed to this technique working, and when we get accustomed, we get comfortable; when we get comfortable, we tend to not bother with keeping ahead of the game. And I’m guilty, too, so please don’t take this as some high-and-mighty patronization: My organization has been tiering/pyramiding links since it was proven to work and have done it all the way up to basically yesterday. And now we’re not, not in the way we and everyone else has been, anyway.  That all of us have ridden the SERPs gravy train this long with link tiering/pyramiding is what we should all be shocked about, not that we’ve finally been busted. Backlink tiering/pyramiding in the way it has been done is a Link Scheme by definition, and is now – I believe – the largest blip on Google’s spam-dar.   The Common Denominators/Link Types Used of Sites that were Penalized   And yes, there do appear to be some across-the-board commonalities, in spite of needing to focus on one’s niche as a whole for specific, detailed answers:   Exact anchor text: There doesn’t seem to be a common percentage threshold, however, so look to your specific niche. Extensive link tiering/pyramiding. Spun 2.0s (usually en masse and as a majority of one’s profile). Extensive article marketing with essentially the same article (resulting mainly in link devaluation outside of the instances in which Google deems a directory as part of a spam network). Blog Networks (these are being caught more and more because they are not niche-specific, topically consistent sites = flag). A greater number of irrelevant links in one’s profile than relevant, quality links. (The threshold for this is appears to be frighteningly low, too. I saw one instance just yesterday of a penalized site whose profile contains no more than 20% of its links from irrelevant sites via high PR blog comments). Combinations/permutations of the above Yes, there’s probably more; no, not all of these will apply to you.    What To Do  For quite a few of you, I imagine this is going to be anti-climactic. There’s no small irony in this, because it is for you that I’m actually writing this the most.  First, you can’t backlink, naked URL or social signal your way out of this. If you have websites that were obliterated by Penguin (and I mean –30 or more in SERPs nearly across-the-board for your keywords), and, you’ve only got a trickle of traffic from low-rent long tails or image search, and it’s showing no dramatic signs of recovery in the next 15 days – abandon the site, or figure out new traffic streams if the site lends itself to them. Your life in organic search for these sites is toast. The time and perhaps money you will spend flailing about in this unknown and unknowable SEO environment is simply not worth just starting over with something else and/or repurposing your approach if not the site, itself. Got PR? Sell it, as just one quick example – it’s better than nothing, right?  Diversify not only your website portfolio, but your SEO approach to all of them, and do it yesterday; this will include the addition of test sites to your portfolio for purposes of experimentation. While I indeed feel for all of the people in all of the threads here screaming at Google and pulling their hair out, this is the surest indicator of someone who got waaaaayyyyy too comfortable with the profitability of one or a few sites, that utilized only one or a few different traffic streams. Again, not a criticism – you should have seen me after the first iteration of Panda. Which I now thank goodness for, actually, since it not only forced me to drastically diversify my online income streams, but to diversify into offline ventures as well.   The Future of SEO  Anyone who claims to have a firm grasp on this right now should, in my opinion, be avoided, lest they do a document dump on all of us containing scientifically controlled for data. What I can give is my opinion, and my opinion only – here it is:  Google’s entire link-based model is outdated and moving towards a new paradigm in which the link base will remain, but will be remarkably altered in nature by behavior patterns on the Web, as well as Social models that we’ve not yet seen. In the near future, however, I think we’ll be seeing niche-relevant blog networks popping up, concentrating on well-written content.  Put very simply, the near future of SEO looks expensive, but that’s how shit goes, too. It’s the story of the ages: the only way the little guy wins is to become the big guy.   Be that guy.

Help in identifying UK television drama possibly based on "The Turn of the Screw	Television; 	Sometime in the late 1960s (or possibly early 1970s) a television drama was screened in the UK. I suspect that it was based on Henry James's 'The Turn of the Screw'. My recollection is that the two children in the production wore long nightshirts and had long (very long) fingernails. In one scene a scratching sound is heard. This is later revealed to have been the sound of fingernails scratching on a door (the scratch marks are shown). At the end of the production, it is revealed that one character's heart has been removed (the implication is that this has also been the work of the children with long fingernails). I haven't been able to find out the name of this production by looking for adaptations of based on 'The Turn of the Screw', but perhaps someone remembers or knows of the production.

It gives me the options "Done" or "Retry"; neither works.  Sometimes the "waiting" message appears under the app logo, sometimes not.
