Brian Olson : Hi Brian,  I guess I'm like the proverbial "taxi driver in Beverly Hills with a new screen play in my pocket looking for a producer to read it and make a movie out of it".    I found a very large niche market for online ecommerce.  Here is the concept.  Large retailers and online shopping sites control the majority of the online shopping exposure. In 2008 the Internet’s ecommerce industry was dominated by 500 companies who controlled 69.1% of all US retail web sales which totaled $178.2 billion. The purpose of KIKIJU.com (the name of my proposed web site) is to provide an online sales platform for the 1.6 million Small to Medium Size Business (SMB) retailers to advance their exposure and enhance their profits on the Internet and capture the remaining 30% ($53 billion) of the ecommerce market.  I have a detailed business plan, and I need to find a "producer" who can take it and make it happen.  Brian, do you have any suggestions?  Thank you.
