Hi I'm a very shy guy. I never had a girlfriend. I'm 21. There is this pretty girl in my math class in college. I want to introduce myself to here, but I don't want to come off creepy. How do I approach her? After class? Before class? Also. I know her name because the instructor was taking role and her name came up. I found out because she rose her hand. I found her on facebook. Should I send her a friend request? Or will that come off as creepy? I haven't talked to her at all yet.

How do I convince ambitious girl that I'm a great partner for her? We know each other for 3 years. This year she appeared to me as a girl, who I want to be with. We have been 2 times on a "dates". Once in cinema and once in coffee bar. Also we have been to 3 school trips, where I shot about 150 photos of her. She knows about every photo. We had a lot of fun together :) She likes me (my stupid jokes, my helpful and big-hearted character, says I'm handsome), but she says now, she doesn't have time to go out with me. She sings, plays guitar, makes handmade jewellery and work hard for school, so she may have less free time. But maybe she doesn't want to be with me because she is not ready? She's a pretty girl and I know some guys want to date her too. I'm not desperate, so I won't beg her to date me, but it would be perfect to be with her.  P.S. I'm 19 and she's 16?

I am a software engineer fresh out of college and have been working in a software company for the past  6months- specifically system software-core. I am a computer science engineer from a reputed Indian engineering college.  I am planning to do an MBA within the next couple of years or so. I have a few assumptions for which I need validation- I am of the opinion that the work experience I'm gaining will not be of much value for admission into an MBA college as well as after the course. So I'm thinking of shifting to a business intelligence company. I think this would be apt for me before an MBA since this would not only harness my technical skills but also expose me to the business aspects, which is so not the case in my current job.   So I wanted to know if my assumptions are correct. Also, which type of company should I join-something like JP Morgan which has major BI teams already or some start up, tons of which are coming up.  And, what is the knowledge I am expected to have in case I go for an interview in one of these companies? Lastly, should I also keep my college achievements in my resume, since there are hardly any achievements in my professional life till now.   Thanks a lot?

Suman Karumuri : I sent this to your email address but it bounced.  Here's what I sent:  Hi Suman,     I got your name from a question that you answered on Quora about the best online e-commerce shopping cart.     We are a tiny business, and we currently use PDG (enterprise edition). Unlike the previous questioner, we have many SKUs (over two thousand products, and they come in many colors as well).     We too care about coupon codes, security, inventory tracking, and shipping integration, but also the ability to have multiple special offers that automatically expire after a certain period (e.g., 20% if you order within the next two weeks).  We've also thought about having a "frequent flier" component where regular customers are offered increased discounts to buy more.     One added complication for our site: we actually have TWO sites: one is wholesale for our retail customers, and the other is our consumer site for regular folks who want our proucts.     Other desired features:     *         Search (must distinguish between consumers and wholesale since we do  not want our consumer customers to have access to our whoesale pricing structure);  *         Sort products by price on website;  *         Have zoom feature so that folks can see products in greater detail;  *         Have ability to generate (and track) gift certificats);  *         Password protected;  *         Ability to maintain different products in different subcategories;  *         Ability to copy products (so that when we are reentering data about the same product, we can then simply change one filed, e.g., color or price, instead of reentering all of the data again;  *         Allow for "breadcrumbs" so that we could say when someone likes a particular product: "Others who have liked that product have also liked this product."     Thanks Suman.
