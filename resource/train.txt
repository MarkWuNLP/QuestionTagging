Can a hotel in Texas refuse to give guest personal belongings if they have not paid for a room damage?	Hotels; 	I recently had a guest who smoked in an non-smoking room and while smoking they put cigarette holes in the bedspread. The guest was informed of the room being a non-smoking room and of a fine of $100 if the guest smokes in the room. When they were caught smoking, we asked them to move to a smoking room and pay $160 for smoking in a non-smoking room and $60 for damaging the bedspread. The guest refused to pay for the damages and called police so that they would get into their room to gather their personal belongings.  When the police came, I informed them of the situation, but one of the officer said we can not legally keep a guest belongings.  I think this is wrong because some states have innkeepers law, where hoteliers are allowed to keep personal belongings till they get paid.  I am not sure if this is the case in Texas, I would appreciate your help!

Hotels; Hotel Management; Behavioral Economics; Hotel Marketing; Price Discrimination; Marketing; Economics; 	I often use Hotel Tonight and Hotwire to book rooms at the last minute.  In virtually all cases I arrive to a half empty hotel and are clearly given one of the worst rooms.

What is the best strategy?

Hi I'm a very shy guy. I never had a girlfriend. I'm 21. There is this pretty girl in my math class in college. I want to introduce myself to here, but I don't want to come off creepy. How do I approach her? After class? Before class? Also. I know her name because the instructor was taking role and her name came up. I found out because she rose her hand. I found her on facebook. Should I send her a friend request? Or will that come off as creepy? I haven't talked to her at all yet.	Dating and Relationships;

How do I stop sending creepy/rude messages on Facebook when I get drunk?	Drunkenness; Facebook User Tips; Life Advice; 	I have become âthat guyâ, the social idiot who seems normal at first, but creeps everyone out by sending terrible drunken messages.  Usually Iâm quiet and well behaved, sometimes I have negative thoughts, but Iâm generally quite happy (at least I think I am). My problem is that every few weeks (could be months sometimes) I get drunk and send messages on Facebook.  I send the messages to a lot of people.  People I have recently met, friends and people I used to know.  I usually tell them creepy things about how I used to like them, or that I used to hate them, that I hate them now or sometimes just random things, but most often my messages are very rude and obscene.  The person I treat the worst is a girl who I wanted to date once.  I havenât seen her in years but Iâm still mad that she didnât like me, jealous that she dated friends of mine and angry that I couldnât get her to like me.   This has been happening for a couple years now.  I know that I need to change soon or I will be like this forever.  I know that Iâm harassing people when I do this and I feel terrible.

How would God say someone should be a good friend to someone who comes to them with problems all the time but never takes their advice? Examples below.	Friendship; Religion; Psychology; 	Example 1- (Her) "I just don't want to live any more and I've decided that starving myself is the best way to kill myself because it did the most damage the last time."  (Me) "I think starving yourself is just going to make you weaker & would be a long, painful process.  Plus, I don't think you really want to die or you wouldn't be talking about it with me.  I think you just want out of the pain."  (Her) "Shelly, nothing you say will make me change my mind.  My mind is set & that's that."   I told her aunt in chat on Facebook & all she had to say is "she's a drama queen biotch" & "I don't believe that for a minute or she would be losing weight."    Example 2- (Her) "Last week, when I had sex with Antonio, I decided I didn't want to be with him, because it turns out he doesn't know a thing about sex.  But just last night, his little brother Caleb came over and oh he is so good in bed!"  (Me) "I didn't know you did anything with either of them.  Whatever happened to Calvin, the minister at that church?"  (Her) "Well, he's good at oral sex but really, he's history.  I just want something new."  (Me) Well, let me suggest that you're using these guys to distract you from the pain inside & that any time you feel any pain, you'd rather numb out from it than face it."  (Her) "Maybe I DO want to numb out from it.  What's wrong with that?  Plus, there's nothing wrong with a little fun." (Me) "Yes, but don't you want a man to love you?  Don't you want to have a happy marriage down the road?  How are you going to get there unless you learn to appreciate yourself & deal with what's going on inside?  Doesn't it bother you that in the past year you have had sex with about 10 different guys & in the past two weeks the last 2 were brothers? (Her) "Shelly.  You are not going to make me feel bad about myself.  This is my path & I'm fine with it.  Why can't you be??  What I need is a supportive friend, not someone who's always slashing into me, attacking me!" (Me) "When you first came to me, it was with the request that I give you advice, help you with your problems.  All I'm doing is pointing out what I see you doing wrong.  I also tell you when I'm proud of you."  (Her) "Yeah, well I just don't see it.  You're always attacking me & I'm afraid if I say the wrong thing back, you're going to leave me again.  As far as that kind of relationship, I don't want you to play the teacher role with me any more.  In a few months, I will be 18.  I think I can figure it out for myself now & I want you to see me as an equal."  (Me) "Listen, I respect your right to make your own decisions.  But you're the one coming to me with your problems.  Do you want my feedback or do you just want me to lie & tell you what you want to hear??  I am here for you but you know how I feel about all this sex in your life.  You know that I'm a Christian & what I believe Jesus said about this.  If you don't want to hear what I have to say, why aren't you going to someone else?? (Her) "Shelly, why do you have to push me away like that??  Now you're going to leave?  I've always thought of you as like a mother to me.  Why can't you love me as much as you love your son?  Because of you, I'm crying so hard I can't even see!  Now I have nothing left to hope for!"   From the suggestions others have given me on this, which includes her, har aunt, my mom and a friend from church, my options are:   -show her more support and don't be critical of any of her behavior. -ignore her and don't let her push my buttons -just stop talking to her altogether.  She's not open to your advice and just wants to hear herself talk. -be there for her when she calls and answer her questions.  When she doesn't like what you have to say, tell her that's your advice and let her go.  Other than this, pray for her.  That's all you can do.   I think I like the last option best.  I don't want to walk away, yet I don't want to say there's nothing wrong with her behavior at all.

After that, to test the performance, i simply do vector multiplication as :   testScores_A = w_A'*testHistograms_A+bias_A testScores_B = w_B'*testHistograms_B+bias_B  testHistograms vector contains data from all 4 different classes.   After having all 4 test scores respectively (if all steps are right above?), i am confused on :   How to calculate precision-recall?  How to calculate confusion matrix?   Thanks a lot in advance.

How do I handle my girlfriend talking to a guy friend, a lot?	Dating and Relationships; 	I've been dating this girl for about 10 months now, and it's been a roller coaster of a ride. Both good and bad. When things are great between us, when we're both happy, it's the most amazing time of my life, a time I don't want to let go. But when things aren't so great, it absolutely sucks and I wish it could go back to the happy times.  Over the past few weeks she's been talking to a friend of hers. I haven't met him, but she said they go a ways back. Now I don't have a problem with her talking to guys, but what I do have a problem with is the amount of talking (texting almost constantly) and Skyping till 3 or 4 in the morning. She gets extremely upset with me every time I bring up how uncomfortable I am with it. And she keeps saying that there's nothing going on and that I have to get over it. If I can't then she's leaving me.  Every time they talk she'll tilt her phone a bit so I can't see, or when they're on Skype and I'm falling asleep, she'll move her screen so I can't see. She says she doesn't like people looking at her screen, but I just don't know.  I want to believe her, I want to trust her and I want to be okay with this. But I just can't. Maybe I'm jealous, maybe I'm insecure in my abilities to keep her as my girlfriend.  I just don't know how to handle this. I just want to be okay with it. :(  She's amazing and I love her. And I might be reading this so incorrectly that I'm being an idiot. But I don't want to lose her.

How do I convince ambitious girl that I'm a great partner for her? We know each other for 3 years. This year she appeared to me as a girl, who I want to be with. We have been 2 times on a "dates". Once in cinema and once in coffee bar. Also we have been to 3 school trips, where I shot about 150 photos of her. She knows about every photo. We had a lot of fun together :) She likes me (my stupid jokes, my helpful and big-hearted character, says I'm handsome), but she says now, she doesn't have time to go out with me. She sings, plays guitar, makes handmade jewellery and work hard for school, so she may have less free time. But maybe she doesn't want to be with me because she is not ready? She's a pretty girl and I know some guys want to date her too. I'm not desperate, so I won't beg her to date me, but it would be perfect to be with her.  P.S. I'm 19 and she's 16?	Love;

Also being in both fields, how do you find the job market? Which market do you think is better? I do a lot of tech blogging for different sites, and it seems that there are more coders then ever!  Thanks so much -Jeff?	Direct Question;

Will the 10x engineers reveal themselves OR can we come up with a better name?	Engineering; Productivity; 10X Engineers; 	In my experience I have never met developers who called themselves "10x engineers".

Plus they love to debug code."  Are there developers out there willing to say, "Yes, I am 10x" or can we come up with a better name?

How come Dropbox has not been acquired yet?	Silicon Valley Mergers and Acquisitions; Dropbox; 	Don't get me wrong I love Dropbox and have been using it since day one. I'm just really amazed to see that the company has remained independent and all the more surprised not to have heard/read  rumors about a potential acquisition.  I cannot believe that Dropbox has not been approached by Google, Microsoft, or Apple.  So I guess i'm wondering why would Dropbox refuse to be acquired and what would they gain by remaining independent. I mean, however good the service may be, synchronization remains a sort of niche service for geeks.  I know Dropbox's co-founder Drew Houston in on Quora. I would love to hear what he has to say.

User Experience; Startups in India; Design; Finding Co-Founders; Startups; Startup Advice and Strategy; 	Is it more difficult for a young technology startup from India to find a UX/UI designer with an entrepreneurial spirit?   Is it difficult to find a design intern in India who could join at early stage of a startup and work all the way to become the Chief Design Officer.

How do I explain to my friend that I don't want to know what he gets up to with another guy in the bedroom, not because I'm homophobic, but because I just don't want to know?	Homophobia; Homosexuality; Dating and Relationships; 	He's a friend of mine who hasn't publicly come out of the closet, but he has outed himself to me. So there are certain aspects of his life that he can't talk about with anyone, including his own family. So he chooses to share these aspects with me. However, he goes into vivid detail when it comes to sexual activities with other guys. When I tell him I don't want to know, he implicitly accuses me of homophobia and expresses distress. What he doesn't seem to understand is I wouldn't want to know even if he was with a girl. I'm just uncomfortable with people I know in real life telling me about what they get up to beyond a certain level of detail. I've put this across in this manner, but he hasn't changed in this regard. I don't want him to feel like he has lost me as a confidant. I don't know if its relevant, but I'm a guy too.

I am a software engineer fresh out of college and have been working in a software company for the past  6months- specifically system software-core. I am a computer science engineer from a reputed Indian engineering college.  I am planning to do an MBA within the next couple of years or so. I have a few assumptions for which I need validation- I am of the opinion that the work experience I'm gaining will not be of much value for admission into an MBA college as well as after the course. So I'm thinking of shifting to a business intelligence company. I think this would be apt for me before an MBA since this would not only harness my technical skills but also expose me to the business aspects, which is so not the case in my current job.   So I wanted to know if my assumptions are correct. Also, which type of company should I join-something like JP Morgan which has major BI teams already or some start up, tons of which are coming up.  And, what is the knowledge I am expected to have in case I go for an interview in one of these companies? Lastly, should I also keep my college achievements in my resume, since there are hardly any achievements in my professional life till now.   Thanks a lot?

How do lawyers form classes of plaintiffs for class actions?	Legal Issues; Law Firms; Litigation and Lawsuits; Attorneys; Law; Class Actions; 	I'm thinking more consumer class actions rather than securities and shareholder suits.  How does the lead attorney go about forming the class? Do they simply take one lead plaintiff who seems to have a claim that probably has affected a lot of people and promise to the court (on some evidentiary basis) that there are likely to be a lot more plaintiffs? Or do they need something more than that before asking for certification?  Do they have to have the class formed prior to asking for class certification?   If not, how long, if they even have to, do they have until they have to come up with more than numerous hypothetical plaintiffs and be able to say "there are actually a lot of plaintiffs I can specifically point to"?   I'm trying to do some research on this and the pain points for lawyers with regard to forming class actions, so if you could answer here and/or fill out my (very very short) Google Survey, it'd be much appreciated.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHo4WTRLMzA3QTFMM19yMkdPdlhlaFE6MQ

Suman Karumuri : I sent this to your email address but it bounced.  Here's what I sent:  Hi Suman,     I got your name from a question that you answered on Quora about the best online e-commerce shopping cart.     We are a tiny business, and we currently use PDG (enterprise edition). Unlike the previous questioner, we have many SKUs (over two thousand products, and they come in many colors as well).     We too care about coupon codes, security, inventory tracking, and shipping integration, but also the ability to have multiple special offers that automatically expire after a certain period (e.g., 20% if you order within the next two weeks).  We've also thought about having a "frequent flier" component where regular customers are offered increased discounts to buy more.     One added complication for our site: we actually have TWO sites: one is wholesale for our retail customers, and the other is our consumer site for regular folks who want our proucts.     Other desired features:     *         Search (must distinguish between consumers and wholesale since we do  not want our consumer customers to have access to our whoesale pricing structure);  *         Sort products by price on website;  *         Have zoom feature so that folks can see products in greater detail;  *         Have ability to generate (and track) gift certificats);  *         Password protected;  *         Ability to maintain different products in different subcategories;  *         Ability to copy products (so that when we are reentering data about the same product, we can then simply change one filed, e.g., color or price, instead of reentering all of the data again;  *         Allow for "breadcrumbs" so that we could say when someone likes a particular product: "Others who have liked that product have also liked this product."     Thanks Suman.     Marc	Direct Question;

What are the real costs of borrowing against your IRA in the United States?	Investment Strategies; Debt; Individual Retirement Account (IRA); 	The question of borrowing against your IRA is fraught with how bad an idea it is, that there is a 10% penalty, taxable distribution after 60 days, and possible state income taxes.  But that's not very practical insight.    Considering the value created through the investments had, how would such penalties compare relative to a traditional investment with capital gains?  Or the average credit card debt?  For someone not familiar with thinking though such numbers, the opportunity to borrow against an IRA sounds like taxable distribution, which is what you would pay anyway on investments, and a cost of 10% (which is less than most credit card rates).  Help simplify this.  Is it better to borrow against a ROTH?

What's the best way to deal with my parents asking to borrow money from me?	Loans; Money; Family and Families; Personal Finance; 	My parents are having some hard times financially and have asked me for some help to make ends meet until they can downsize (they own their house and will probably sell it in the next 5 years, when they'd pay me back).  I have already lent them some money over the past few years, and to be honest, I don't expect to see it.  I've come to terms with that, I think.  This brings up a lot of weird feelings for me.  On one hand, these are my parents!  They did so much for me.  Even looking at it from a purely financial perspective, they've given me much more than what they're asking for.    On the other hand, I know what a bad idea it is to let money come in between personal relationships, whether we're talking about family or friends.  I'm afraid that if I'm not paid back, I'll harbor these feelings of resentment.  I already do, to a small extent.  And also I *will* need this money at some point, and it is not an insignificant amount.  It would be the down payment on a very nice place, or could sustain me living (my current lifestyle) for several years.  It also just bothers me to think about the whole situation.  It sounds horrible to say but it just shows a weakness in my family that I'm not comfortable with.    How should I be looking at this?  I'm not rich by any means, but I do have money saved that I definitely won't need for awhile.  The total amount between what I've given them already and what they're asking for will end up being about 25% of my net worth.  Do people think "of course, they're your parents - just give it to them"?  Would it be reasonable to suggest getting a loan instead?  The downside would be that it would be more expensive for them, even if they do pay me back (with interest, as they're proposing), because of all the origination costs.  The upside of course, is that it keeps me out of it.  I don't doubt that they really do intend to pay me back, and when they sell the house, they'll have the means to do it.  So it's better for them to owe that money to a bank than to me, right?  Thanks for any advice you can give, or any other things I should be thinking about.

Why don't people return books after borrowing them from friends?	Books; Manners and Etiquette; Friendship; 	I have never once -- never once -- gotten a book back after lending it to a friend. No, I don't have especially awful friends. There's just something in particular about books, as opposed to other objects, which makes borrowers feel that it's okay not to return them. I have friends who would never think of borrowing a blouse without returning it -- these same friends will never return a borrowed book.   And oddly, you feel rather petty for asking a friend to return a book. Perhaps because you've got another thousand waiting for you on your shelves -- I don't know why I hesitate to ask friends to return books. Seven months ago, someone borrowed an expensive, large book from us. I don't think he's forgotten he has it -- in fact, I have no doubt it is prominently displayed on his coffee table.   Here's a nice Charles Lamb quote which sums up how I feel: "Borrowers of books, those mutilators of collections, spoilers of the symmetry of shelves, and creators of odd volumes.

Why is it important that poor and middle class people indebt themselves, reduce their ability to absorb volatility in their lives and owe people money?    Why is that ("access to credit") something that is desired?    What long-term good comes from indebting oneself more?  Would love everyones thoughts!

While usury is prohibited by Islam and Christianity, is borrowing considered sinful?	Theology; Religion; 	thank  you for your answers, very interesting.  What i am trying to understand  specifically is whether theology, particularly Islamic and christian,  have influenced contemporary ethical discourses around money,  particularly financial prudence and a sense of moral unease around  borrowing.  Mohammed, i find your statement that lending can be seen as a  form of charity in a Muslim ethical framework really interesting.  i  wonder how the borrower in this equation is viewed: is any judgment made  about his morality or status, and if so is this in anyway related to  Islamic theology? i guess i should  rephrase my question without reference to usary or implicit reference to  profit through interest: is there anything in Muslim or christian  theology which has influenced current discourse around borrowing money  in christian and muslim communities, and in modern secular states with  muslim or christian traditions?

Can a 501(c)(3) legally borrow money from individuals at 0% interest?	Nonprofit Organizations; Tax Law; Non-profit Accounting; 	I'm trying to help a 501(c)(3) elementary school update their classroom computers (10+ year old tech).

Democracy; Corporate Culture; Economics; Peace; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; Capitalism; Occupy Wall Street; Nonprofit Organizations; Socialism; Corporate Structures; 	If one agrees that the Occupy movement has a valid point -- in that governments and the economy have been doing a very poor job of promoting economic wellbeing -- then it makes sense to look for a concrete goal that the movement might adopt.  And it is not false to write that very large for-profit corporations have their own internal cultures, and have a huge impact on society.  Might it be possible to counteract this (negative) cultural influence by requiring that all of these very large corporations be required, at a certain level, to become nonprofit -- with a mission to serve the public good?  I imagine that many of the heinous things done in the name of profit might be rightly curtailed.  Would this satisfy the Occupy movement's focus, and also lead to a benefit here in the US and globally?  Might it be possible to preserve the entrepreneurial spirit in a place by allowing medium-sized corporations to "slip under" the requirement, thereby promoting innovation, success, creativity, wealth, and all of the other things which make creating a business so attractive to some people and their families?  Is anyone actively promoting such a stance?  All thoughts and answers welcome.

Should Indian Government link essential subsidies to family planning?	India; Economics; Macroeconomics; Subsidies; Government of India; 	Should Indian Government link essential subsidies to family planning ? Should the government need to be real strict with: "if you want essential stuff for free, stop with one kid" ?  From my casual observation, I see that the (case1) 'poor' families that receive AND make use of government subsidies (free food grains, free basic electricity, free schooling, free medical care, free house-hold appliances, free laptop etc ) generally have more children per family ...  than (case2) the educated / earning families that do not receive / make use of (due to ineligibility) these subsidies.   I feel, the case-1 people DO NOT understand / realize the 'actual cost' of bringing up children, and hence do not worry about having more of them.  Whereas, the case-2 people pay taxes PLUS spend a huge amount on each of the above mentioned stuff. Hence they foresee the real burden (self responsibility) in bringing up each kid, and hence limit themselves to 1 or max 2 children per family.   The irony being: all the subsidies for case1 are made possible through the taxes paid by case2.   Isn't this like robbing Peter to pay Paul, encouraging the creation of more poorer Pauls, and (indirectly) encouraging the creation of fewer Paul's?   Whereas the exact opposite could lead to true betterment at macro level in long term (more educated+healthy+richer citizens to subsidise the Paul's), ultimately reducing the rich-poor gap .  Should the government need to be real strict with: "if you want essential stuff for free, stop with one kid" ?

What is considered a healthy gross profit margin? what path should I take?	Retail; 	Hi,  I have just started a niche business of importing foreign goods at factory prices direct from the manufacturer and selling them at my retail shop at an average markup of Landing cost x 2 + local taxes or at a margin of ~50%.  I have a retail shop and I also sell to institutions (training institutes) who want to provide their students with my products. More often than not, these institutes expect to earn a big margin sometimes 20-30% on their order which I wish were huge. I also sell some local niche brands in my shop on a consignment basis and I pay the vendor at month end the sales - my margin.  I need some advice on  1. is the markup of 2x or margin of 50% healthy comparable to the retail industry or am I underselling ?  2. With institutions what model should I follow     (a) give them a discount on every purchase     (b) let them take my imported branded goods on a consignment basis and pay me monthly based on their sales. 3. Am I a retailer or trader?  Mind you the institutions have no retail background and are generally unprofessional when it comes to taking responsibility of my products on a consignment basis. I am better off selling to them at a discount and not worry about the sales.  I like to think I am more of a Retailer who wants to reach the customers directly offline and online.  Any other advise on how to move forward to increase sales and turnover via tuning pricing model and giving incentive scheme would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers, Joe

Has the Indian government planned and executed long term economic plans spanning more than a decade?	India; Politics; Economics; 	India, being a democracy is prone to thinking in terms of 4-5 year plans (till the next election) and does not have any long term plans spanning decades like the PRC does.

I am not trying to criticize the 5 year plans, but want to know if there have been any long term well executed plans in terms of economics, foreign policy or urban development. My thought process is that Indian high command seems to lack this particular trait and it is severely crippling development. Any added insight would be great.

For the last month, I've been following a laid back routine - 25 push-ups+sit-ups+crunches per day. I used to do close to 100, when I was preparing for my black-belt test, but I was pretty busy after that and fitness took a back seat...  Presently, I'm 5'8" (172.72 cm) and weigh 132 lb (60 kg).

How much more does a steel and glass residential apartment building cost to build than a concrete/brick structure?	Buildings; Real Estate; Construction; Civil Engineering; Residential Construction; 	As someone who vastly prefers to live in housing that offers maximal window space, I often wonder why all new urban residential complexes are not steel and glass so as to offer as much natural light and viewing area as possible.  I assume that it is because the construction method is substantially more expensive and buyer willingness to pay is not high enough to meet the price point that would be implied.  Does anyone know how much of a cost premium (e.g. 25% more expensive, or $ per square foot more, perhaps) is typically associated with a building of this type, relative to buildings like those typically seen in a major branded development that is more traditional construction with smaller windows, like Avalon, etc?

For sprinting I imagine there is a different balance since muscle cells can hold much of their own fuel for short distances.

What are some useful approaches to deciding whether to schedule a job candidate's interviews for 30, 45, or 60 minutes in duration amongst a series of interviewers?	Job Interviews; Recruiting; Hiring; Scheduling; 	For instance, the job candidate needs to meet with 4 interviewers, some of whom would be potential team members, and one is the hiring manager. They each have varying interests in who is hired and also they each have varying degrees of busy schedules. The easiest thing would be to schedule 30 minutes for each team member and then end it with 60 minutes for the hiring manager.  But what if 30 minutes is too short for a thorough enough interview? What if an interviewer doesn't need all of 60 minutes?  45 minutes is nice amount of time for an interview, but it then slices into people's calendars of other 30 or 60 minute appointments.  I'm wondering if any recruiters, recruiting coordinators, office managers, receptionists, hiring managers, or even job seekers, have useful ideas to approach this. I've been doing recruiting for many years and it seems there's only so much that can be done with this scheduling issue.

What should I do if I've lost my self-confidence in college?	Life; Expatriate Life in Japan; Chinese American Culture; Depression; The College and University Experience; Chinese Culture; Life Advice; Psychology; 	I'm a 23 year old female currently completing my last year of college on the east coast. Until middle school, I was raised by Chinese parents inside Tokyo, Japan. While in Japan, my father's company was in danger of bankruptcy, and he left Japan and immigrated to the States. Immediately after arriving in States he was involved in yet another company that also went bankrupt, and my family subsequently experienced a long period of unemployment. I spent my middle school and high school in States being constantly worried about my family's money and being extremely lonely. I only spoke Japanese at that time, and it was hard to make friends in school as nobody spoke Japanese. The only thing I thought about prior to college was how to survive till the next day.  I studied very hard in high school and entered a target college on east coast. In college I had no idea what I wanted to pursue. I chose an relatively rare major - actuarial science, because I heard that this would lead to a good job prospect and earn a lot of money - I needed the money. But I had no idea what I was getting myself into, and did not have the mathematical ability to succeed in that major. My GPA slid down from 3.7 in 1st year to 1.5 in 2nd year. At the time, I considered changing my major, but made the mistake of thinking that I did not have the luxury to put off graduation and start working later. I continued taking mathematics, and since then my overall cumulative GPA has been 2.7.  During my 3rd year I felt extremely depressed about my grades and my life in general. I do not speak to my father more than once per year. I had no other family in the US. I thought that perhaps I should go live in China after graduation, since that is where my extended family lives (my grandparent etc). I needed family. I applied for and was accepted to an internship program in a Chinese bank. I performed well within the bank, but for life in China itself, I had a huge reverse culture shock - had never lived there before, and could not get into the core of Chinese society. I came back to school, and applied and was accepted to 2 local internships in banks. While I was at the 1st bank, the department which I was hired under became the target of a takeover, and many employees were laid off. At the 2nd bank the bank did not hire anyone from the intern pool.   As graduation loomed I felt very upset and worried about job prospects. I speak Japanese and Mandarin fluently so I thought I would leave the States completely. I spent a large amount of effort , applied for numerous positions inside Japan, and received a full time offer in Tokyo. However, right after the offer, Japan was hit by the 3.11 earthquake, and became polluted by radiation.   All my family and people around me are telling me not to go. My father has called me a loser for going to Japan because I "could not make it in the US and am running away to Japan". Right now I feel as if I failed in college... wrong major... low GPA...didn't get a job out of any of my internships... only full time offer I have is in Japan, but I'm scared of radiation, really don't know if it's safe to go live there now...  My memories of life in US are dominated by worrying about money, not being able to fit in among others, having family problems. I thought maybe I could regain inner peace if I went back to Japan but my childhood is gone and my family there is gone, and I'll be by completely by myself in the country, yet again.. I feel like I don't belong here or anywhere and there is no place for me in this world.  I have struggled for many years to try to remain strong, but recently I feel as though I can't go on anymore... I don't know where to go or who to turn to in life and feel completely lost. Any advice would be appreciated.

How much responsibility do poor people have for their own poverty?	Economics; Poverty; Personal Responsibility; Walmart; 	I thought about this when I read the following comment left by an anonymous person on Yahoo.  The original poster said the following:  "Our city just opened up a new Walmart. My buddy got a job there. He  still has to apply for food stamps because Walmart doesn't hire full  time and he makes $8.80 an hour. You can't pay the bills on the wages we  get these days! We need real jobs that pay more."  This is what one person responded:   "I'm not sure about you, but whenever I go into Walmart, I don't really  see that the vast majority of the employees working there have a whole  lot of skill and education to offer up. Why should Walmart have to pay  these folks more money (and therefore the rest of us pay higher prices  for everything we buy there) just because these people can't support  themselves on a Walmart job alone. If they don't have anything more to  offer why don't they either 1) go work another job on top of the one @  Walmart or 2) go get themselves an education in order to get a higher  paying job or 3) go to a trade school and learn something useful. I'm so  sick of these folks whining all the time!"  This led me to wonder.... are people poor because it's their own fault?  I.e.: is it the Wal-Mart worker's fault that he/she does not have the skills to get a better job?  Is he/she responsible for his status in society?

I used to be able to chatter quite a bit, but now it's like I have a lot on my mind/humiliation from rejection.

How are confidence intervals at all useful?	Statistics (mathematical science); 	A follow-up to the first answer to the question here: What is a confidence interval in layman's terms? [ http://www.quora.com/What-is-a-confidence-interval-in-laymans-terms ] and a good primer here: Confidence interval [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval ].  Or a summary of the discussion there: A 95% confidence interval does NOT make the statement that the population mean falls in between a lower limit L and an upper limit U 95% of the time. It instead says that 95% of confidence intervals constructed from various samples will contain the population mean. But considering that we can usually only sample once, it tells us nothing about where the population mean might be. Moreover, various political polls use confidence intervals as a basis for a "margin of error" - which seems off.  Why are confidence intervals useful then? What are some of the most damaging ways in which confidence intervals are misused?

Earning a living and acquiring food is more important that getting educated". "Best education" should include apprenticeships, so that the people can earn a living while learning, by learning.  Also imagine the plethora of innovations that might start coming from all corners of the world when a majority of people start getting the best education! The best innovations might come from the people who face the biggest challenges!  If you can deliver the best education to the poorest, then you can essentially deliver it to the whole world. We can already see cost-effective high-quality education being delivered via the internet (e.g. MIT OCW, Khan Academy, Coursera, Udacity, edX)

How can I get my dog to be comfortable with people?	Dog Behavior; Dog Training; 	My dog is scared of people, especially men. I've had trainers tell me to expose her more to people.

How can I learn not to get screwed over and screw other people over?	Life Advice; Social Psychology; Social Advice; Self-Improvement; 	I have been the victim of politics a lot. In a student organization I was in, people would take credit for all my work (when they didn't do anything), but blatantly yelling at them or disagreeing with them in public doesn't seem to help my public image. How do I avoid getting screwed over and screw others over? Please dont give BS answers like, "be nice, dont screw others over" or "if you're nice to people they will be nice to you." It has happened multiple times I had my work taken away as someone's credit. My friends say I'm too soft/weak, and need to learn to be tough and give out the aura that people shouldn't mess with me. How can I do that?
How can I get people to stop telling me what to do?	Social Advice; Advice; Life Advice; 	Because of my position, most people I interact with try to tell me what I should do.  They imagine they are being helpful and often have absolutely no understanding of the challenges and factors affecting me or my projects.  It is lonely and even if I tell then that this is the dynamic I commonly face, they continue. Sometimes I stop talking with anyone, or feel angry. Sometimes I tell them to write their thoughts down since I am open to them, but don't want listening to people tell me what I "have to do" for the rest of my life. I think the last equal and enjoyable conversation I had was over 4 months ago, though the general problem has been going on for years.  Is there a polite way to get them to stop?

Obviously, personal history matters the most. But there are other factors involved too.

How can I get more people to write on Ficly with me?	Creative Writing; Writing; Creative Commons; 	I write on Ficly (http://ficly.com), a Creative Commons-based collaborative writing site where people can write 1024-characters-long story segments, then other people can come in and write prequels and sequels, also 1024 characters in length. It's quite a fun challenge to try to work a coherent story piece into that short a length, and also to respond to what other writers cause to happen over the course of your story.  The problem is that it can sometimes be hard to find anyone who would like to continue any of my stories (or, for that matter, anyone's stories in general). I suspect that this is due at least in part to the relatively small number of writers currently working in Ficly right now. It's not as likely other people will share any given writer's particular interests.  Other writers on Ficly have suggested posting comments to other writers' works to become more visible and draw more attention to my stories, and I plan to try that, but was curious if other people had other suggestions. (Or, for that matter, would like to come to Ficly and write some themselves!)
Does society get a net benefit from lying to poor youth about what they can accomplish?	Startup Advice and Strategy; Venture Capital; Entrepreneurship; Angel Investing; Startups; 	I have seen privileged entrepreneurs raise money and execute on mediocre plans, while a Nobody entrepreneur who has a great idea can never truly get attention from investors.   In Tech stealing ideas is not considered a crime. Hence the truth-ism, "Ideas are a dime a dozen, it is People who can execute that are valuable".  So, Does society get a net benefit from misleading the regular youth about their probability to create success without resources? Consider the damage caused to those who work hard and long only to find the glass ceiling is thick, then watch the privileged execute on their plans?

Basically the human "Operating System." When answering, put aside the question of how "proper" or improper the assessment  of cultural healthiness.

Is there a correlation between how much people like Lost and how poor their quantitative skills are?	Correlations; Logic; Mathematics; Lost (TV series); Intelligence; Television; 	Illogical explanations, or no explanations at all.  It seems to me the only people who would be ok with this are those who fair poorly with logic and reasoning.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that my more mathematically-inclined friends dislike Lost.  Here's a great explanation from one of the Quora answers: There is definitely a correlation between fans of Lost and people who are OK with incredibly awful endings.   As mathematical expressions are elegantly encapsulated from beginning to end (even infinite sequences and series have sigma and pi notation), and lines of software code are neatly completed by semi-colons and carriage returns, I would say that your theory makes sense.

What do you do when your self-confidence fails on you in front of a person you like?	Love; Self-Improvement; Psychology; Self-Confidence; Body Image; 	You stumble and you end up looking weak and stupid. You also leave a really bad impression.   Imagine a scenario: You read poetry, prose. Your heroes don't live on TV screens and you really feel something in a classical music. You have a certain amount of knowledge in your head. You are also emotionally intelligent. You feel compassion and empathy for others, less fortunate.  But one day you meet a person that you find incredible. Your self confidence shatters. It is like standing in the middle of the stadium, with 10.000 people looking at you, and you forget the speech. You feel low, weak and lost. You feel like a complete loser. As if you lost every bit of knowledge and experience that you've gathered throughout the years. A complete failure. Not recognizable to yourself. And days after, that feeling remains. You keep on replaying all the horrible moments in your head. Everything that went wrong, went wrong. She/he is now quiet. There is no phone call, no text and no e-mail. You can feel how she/he thinks about you "what a loser, what a weakling....who is this girl/guy??"   How do you get back on your feet? How do you feel less stupid and reclaim your posture.  Thank you.

How do the wealthy manage friendships with much less wealthy (even poor) people?	Wealthy People and Families; Wealth; 	Say you've got all the money you'll ever need to do anything. But many of your friends from college or life or what have you are still ordinary middle class. You want to go out to fancy restaurants, you want front row seats to U2, you want to tour Europe, you want all the things you can now afford. But they can't afford to join you, but you want their company. And how do you watch them struggling under a mortgage and college tuition bills? It seems unwise to just doll out money-- this could create terrible dependencies. I'm hoping to hear from someone with personal experience.

Questions That Contain Assumptions; Success; Survey Questions; Poor People; Public Education; Poverty; 	It's been proven that "a person of any social-economic background" can, with persistence, rise from the lowest of financial circumstances if he or she doesn't lose sight of prosperity as a goal. Yet I've observed much of the population's poor grovel in poverty for most of their lives.   Who's fault is this? It's not entirely on the government or the rich, is it?  Why do you think the poor remain poor in countries where basic education is free, college loans are nearly guaranteed and knowledge on the internet freely accessible to anyone with a library card?   In fact, many poor people spent more time in our public education system than some of today's Billionaires like Richard Branson or late inventors like Edison. These are facts. Answer accordingly.

Whatever I am today is because of the sacrifices of my parents. In their ambition to give me a better life they have hurt themselves financially and health wise. Currently they around 70 and 65 years of age and looking at their state of health I dont think they have more than 10 years of life left in them.  I feel sad that despite their hard work I am not able to give them anything in return. For example my father always wanted to travel abroad but now his health makes him difficult to travel long distances.   I sometimes feel that I am a bad son and have failed to do my duty towards them. I feel that may be my ambitions were too high, if I had aimed lower may be we wouldn't have been under so much stress.  When I speak to my parents about this that they say that they are very proud of the way I have grown up despite the fact that they could not give me much. They say that they dont want more.  I find it difficult to read their mind.

How does it feel to watch news reports of extreme poverty abroad or even in your own country from your multi-million dollar home?  How does one rationalize extravagance? How do the "haves" reconcile their morality?  Furthermore, what justification is there for gluttony in the moral spectrum? Does it make it okay to live lavishly if you donate some percentage of your money/time to benefit others?  It would be preferable to hear from those of you who actually have significant wealth and are willing to speak openly about how you think about and cope with these moral issues.

How can I prevent my children from having low self-esteem? How can I prevent them from emulating my lack of self-esteem?	Parenting; Child Development; Children; Psychology; Self-Improvement; 	I have always has self-esteem issues ever since I was a kid.I really don't know the reason for that. I feel very uncomfortable accepting compliments and put myself down when someone compliments or praises me, e.g. If my friend says, "Hey, you've lost weight and you look good", my reply would be, "Oh it's the dress that makes me look slim, I am as fat as ever." Even though I know that I DID lose weight.  I have no issues with my appearance as I am very good looking, but my problem is with low self-esteem and I constantly put myself down amongst everyone, at work or in social settings. I make every effort to praise my children for their little achievements but sooner or later, they will take cues from me. I'm afraid they will have self-esteem issues as they grow older. I know how painful each day goes by for me. I do not want my kids to suffer like me. Any suggestions?

Life Advice; Careers; Career Advice; Work; 	I'm cursed - some say blessed but I definitely don't - with a baby face and a voice that is not particularly commanding. Strangers often guess my age at around 22, but I will be 29 soon. I have often felt that I have been passed over for promotions because people view me as some fresh-faced kid out of college. It frustrates me. My bald, bearded friend who is the same age was promoted in half the time despite having a poorer work performance. My reviews are always excellent and I am considered hugely important to my department, but they just won't give me any kind of responsibility. Outside clients also tend to look past me and assume I am some kind of assistant.    My current boss us really nice and fought on my behalf to get me a pay rise, but I've still gone nowhere in the year and a half I've been in this job. I've seen outsiders recruited above me and other people rising quickly. Day to day I don't let this get to me. I just knuckle under and get on with the best job I can and do it well. This is recognised, but just not rewarded. How can I overcome this prejudice?

I have good technical skills and I guess I am better than most of my colleagues. But somehow I always end up getting bad appraisal. I don't know why? I am fed up. But can I be self-employed so that I can support myself ? How to be an independent technical consultant etc.	Self-employed; Employee Engagement; Careers; Self-employment; Career Advice; Career Choices; Startups; Job Satisfaction; Entrepreneurship; 	I am an architect but I feel I am sidelined consistently. When there is a big problem, everybody will turn upon me for a solution and those people will just have intellectual discussions about what to do with the problem. Most of the time they won't come up with anything but fixing a time for the next meeting. Being an architect I need not code. But I didn't want to be an arm-chair architect and so I actively involved in design/coding etc. But I am sidelined when there is a technical discussion involving the "big" people. We end up doing some bad designs for something we did 2 years back. They didn't take my ideas as I was new to the company. But now as we want to scale our product we have to redo stuffs and  that have to be done exactly the way I suggested before.     Secondly, my boss is openly ignoring me. If some technical problem is there, if it is easy he won't even put me in CC and if it is difficult, he will just takes my inputs and mail and I would be in BCC or he would fwd me the mail he sent with my inputs.  I am confident of my technical capabilities. I am providing good designs/code for the products and features and I am also coding for them. But somehow I am ignored when the feature is complete. If they hit upon a wall for problem, of course they will come to me. But when the solution is ignored I am forgotten again.    Third thing is, it seems my company doesn't have much respect for the engineers. The product managers, sales guys get respect. But the engineers don't.   So, what should I do ? I want to leave my job, but in my next job I may end up in the same situation. How can I be self-employed.
Should rich people be compassionate towards the poor or should poor people rejoice with the rich about their fortune?	Poor People; Compassion; Psychology; Being Wealthy; Poverty; Morals and Morality; Wealthy People and Families; Economic Inequality; 	What is the right way to resolve the cognitive dissonance that arises in situations where the 'have's and the 'have-not's meet?  Should the poor attempt to rejoice with the rich about their fortunate, or should the rich be compassionate towards the poor and take responsibility to self-censor their fortune and act self-deprecatingly? Or should they meet each other half-way until the cognitive dissonance disappears? What is the right resolution?  This is not just about financial wealth, but about fortune in general, like health, career, social/romantic relationships, and life situation in general.  We know both "compassion" and "sympathetic joy" are virtues - and both "envy" and "showboating" are vices - but which one is stronger than the other as a moral obligation? It seems to me like compassion is considered more of a moral obligation than sympathetic joy, but envy is considered a bigger vice than showboating and self-promoting.

Since 3 days I force myself to stay in front of the computer. All the pages are right next to me but every time I try to start it is as if I would force myself to put my hand in fire.

Being Single; Dating and Relationships; Self-Confidence; Dating Advice; 	For example, I like women who have high self-confidence and high self-esteem.

All they care about is looks. I also find girls with horrible communication skills and low self-confidence creepy and embarrassing to hang out with. Smoothness in a woman definitely turns me on. Is there something wrong with me instead? What does this say about me? Am I too picky when it comes to picking a potential partner?

What might be the reasons that I suffer from low self esteem, sometimes feel numb, sometimes feel superior to others, sometimes lie and manipulate, sometimes quickly come to hate people, and have various other issues? How can I deal with these issues?	Mental Illness; Medicine and Healthcare; Psychology; Psychiatry; Mental Health; 	Please can somebody help me?  I'm sick of living only half a life.  Even though I try to be normal, and act like other people, on the inside I feel nothing. I know I'm just faking it.    I have spent my life watching how others behave and listening to what they say etc and the emotions that they display under various circumstances.  I can display any emotion, complete with the body language, words, tears (if required), smiles etc, etc.  On the inside, though, I feel nothing like what I'm 'displaying'.  Unless its aggression, anger or absolutely nothing at all.  I only ever get genuinely upset if it's me that is the one suffering.   I've tried putting others before myself, but it just makes me angry because I don't want to do it. I believe I'm better than everyone else. I'm smarter than they are. I feel superior to others.    I will lie, coerce, threaten, trick, con and manipulate people in order to get what I want.  Money, objects, reactions, treated the way I want to be, etc.  I only go out of my way to help people for the 'bonus points' and as 'one good turns deserves another' they can be made to feel obliged to return the favour.   There are some people that I do like, but if they don't treat me the way I want them to, or they offend me in any way, I hate them instantly and will fume for hours, days at a time until I settle the score. I can't let it go and will say nothing, continue being nice, until an opportunity arises whereby I can get even. I don't need them to know I'm behind it, it works for me either way. As long as I know I've got them back, that's all I need in order to feel better again.   I had a child because I thought I would feel real love and affection etc for them and it would cure the nothingness that I have on the inside. It didn't. There's was nothing there. I've never, ever harmed my child in any way and we have a good relationship, as far as my child is concerned. I know this from things said and done, that my child loves me very much and has told me that they had a really good childhood.  My child is now a full, grown adult and visits several times a week. If any problems come up, they will always come to me, because they know I will help them with anything and everything. (I vowed to be the best parent possible because I'd brought this tiny baby into the world, totally innocent and vulnerable.)  I care very much for my child, but I've never loved them.   I knew I wasn't like the other kids at school and, regardless of any bad things that have happened to me, I know I'd have turned out this way.  I've always been like it.   I've seen psychiatrist and psychologists etc, had some CBT and DBT, been medicated with all sorts including mood stabilisers, antipsychotics and antidepressants.  Nothing has worked to change how I feel and view others. I wasn't totally honest with them about everything because I know they would have said I was evil or dangerous. They considered me high risk any way just with the stuff I WAS honest about. Self-preservation stopped me from telling all.   I have no guilty conscience and don't feel any empathy for others. I can talk the talk, but it's just a well-honed act.  I want to be normal and be like other people because I get lonely and everyone else has got friends and family and I have nobody.   Please don't answer with insults or tell me I'm a worthless piece of crap. I am aware of how twisted I am compared to others, but I didn't want to be this way and have tried very hard all my life to be like you. It just never happens.  No matter how I try or what I do, I'm still empty. Unless I feel angry I just feel empty. Full to bursting point of hollow nothingness.   (Based on the info I did tell the shrinks etc they diagnosed a Personality Disorder/Behaviour Disorder, but because I didn't 'fit' any of the ones in their Manuals, the diagnosis changed from Borderline PD, Complex PTSD, possible Bi-Polar, schizo-effective disorder and several others all lumped together.)
